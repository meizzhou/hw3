This repository is your starting point for INFO 343 Lab 2 (Building a Basic Web Site). To get started, Fork this repository (yes, you read that right), into one of your own on GitHub, clone it to your lab computer, and follow the lab instructions.

Specifically, this repository contains the images you'll use for the site, as well as a "reset.css" file, which you should link to from all your pages to reset the various browser defaults. Reset CSS files are useful for maintaining a cosistent look-and-feel between different kinds of browsers, as each one has a slightly different set of defaults for padding, margins, alignment, etc.
